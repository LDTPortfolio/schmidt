                <!--change description of artifact-->    <p>For the final project of this course,  I solo designed and developed an instructional solar system exploration game targeted at high elementary/lower middle school students. AR Space Pathfinders is a mobile science learning game set in our solar system. Students are guided by two main characters: Emperor Jupiter and AI Europa, NPCs that bring them through the different planets of our solar system and provide educational information. Students play mini-games at each of the different planets and are assessed on their knowledge at each stop. During these assessments, players are rewarded points, which also indicate score. Some assessments are timed. Leaderboards are found in minigames, which are also live; players can log their usernames and compete with other players in real-time. The work that was put into this game includes the development of the branching narrative; character/world building; using logic to create the quizzes that total up a player’s score; creating aesthetic value (backgrounds, high-resolution photographs, effects, etc.); researching the planetary information, almost all of which was taken from NASA’s website; development of the minigames, and elements used in the minigames; creating questions based off the content of the narrative; bug and playtesting; etc.</p>
