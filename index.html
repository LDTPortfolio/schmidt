        <h1>Hi there! I'm <span class="about__name">Olivia Schmidt.</span></h1>
        <h2 class="about__role">Learning, Design, and Technology MS Student @ USF &#x1F334.</h2>
        <p class="about__desc">
          I am a native Floridian with roots in St. Petersburg, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Learning Design & Technology (LDT) with a concentration in Game-Based Learning Analytics at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg (USFSP). I achieved Summa Cum Laude honors when I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in English from USFSP in 2022. My decision to apply to the LDT program immediately after graduation was driven by a desire to weave my background in the arts with my passion for technology. I was particularly compelled by the concentration the LDT program offers – Game-Based Learning Analytics.  
        </p>
        <p class="about__desc">
          Prior to joining the LDT program, I played a pivotal role in establishing the Esports program at USF during the summer of 2020, amid the peak of the pandemic. What initially began as a small team evolved into a thriving program with thousands of USF students engaged in Discord communication, participating in recreational campus events, and competing in statewide competitions.
        </p>
        <p class="about__desc">
          During my master's studies, I had the privilege of connecting with the dean of education at the College of Education (COE), St. Petersburg. Recognizing our shared interests in games for education, the dean extended a graduate research assistantship to me. Over the course of a year, I collaborated with David Rosengrant, the dean of the COE at USFSP, conducting research on game-based learning. This experience afforded me the opportunity to witness students' enthusiasm for technology and robotics in our STEM INQ lab, present my research on games and systems thinking at the WiCyS conference in Denver, collaborate with students at UCF’s graduate game design school to produce a cybersecurity game for girl scouts, investigate the use of in-game physics engines to create assessments for high school students, and integrate Minecraft: Education Edition into the classroom to teach coding concepts. All of these experiences were deeply gratifying; I came to realize that ensuring students' motivation, playfulness, and creativity when using these digital tools means everything to me. Concurrently, I have been gaining practical experience in education as a substitute teacher at Plato Academy, St. Petersburg, working across various grade levels.
        </p>
        <p class="about__desc">
          This program has significantly contributed to the attainment of skills and knowledge that I will carry forth with me as I search for careers relevant to my true goal – being part of the wave of educators, learning technologists, and game designers who are creating educational game and gamified experiences for students to engage with. My eventual aim is to contribute to the evolution of innovative and engaging learning environments that empower students to thrive academically and creatively by working in the edugames industry. In the immediate future, I’m positioned to continue my studies at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada,  in the summer of 2024. Québec City is a growing city for the games industry, with dozens of indie game studios and high-level companies, such as Ubisoft and Gearbox, choosing to move their offices here.

        <p class="about__reflection">
          Sorting, compiling, and collating my work from my time in the Learning, Design, and Technology (LDT) program was an extensive task, but ultimately rewarding – more so than I envisioned at the outset of when I began to build out this portfolio. As I went through the assignments of my previous courses, I started to tangibly see the timeline of how I’ve grown in this past year. The beginning of my time in the program was marked by a lack of knowledge of the instructional design field, and very little professional experience in the field of education – now, I find myself as a proficient learner and future practitioner in this field. I hope to take what I’ve learned from this program on instructional design and apply it through the lens of learning with games, or gamification, to create engaging and effective educational experiences for learners.

Throughout the creation process of my E-Portfolio, I feel that the AECT standards served as a valuable framework for assessing how my work has related to the foundational principles of learning and instruction; this process of digging through my old classwork, revisiting old assignment pages, and relating projects to different standards helped me recognize how each course in the LDT program was designed with these standards in mind. I attempted to include in this E-Portfolio some of my best, and often the most major projects, I completed in this program. I would point one toward the very first standard, and the very last standard, as projects I’m particularly proud of. With the knowledge I have now, there are certainly a few projects I would revisit - nevertheless, I remain content with my overall progress and accomplishments I've achieved.

Looking ahead, I am eager to translate what I’ve taken away from this program into my future professional endeavors – applying to positions where learning design meets the boundary of game design. The province of Quebec has carved out a spot for itself as a global leader in video game development; my immediate steps following graduation from this program are to study French intensively and see if any professional opportunities arise in this hotspot for game design and development. I see this as a promising intersection where my newfound skills in instructional design might fuse with game design; I envision the possibility of working for a company that leverages my skills to create gaming experiences that apply principles and theories of instructional design to enhance learning outcomes while making education enjoyable and interactive. Truly, I hope to extend my impact beyond the boundaries of game design by creating new collaborations and partnerships between educational institutions, technology companies, and the gaming industry. I believe that there’s still a movement to be had in bridging the gap between the traditional realm of game design and educational solutions that engage learners of all ages.
